          Iâ€™ve been writing since I was a little girl, finishing my first
          full-length novel at the age of fourteen years old. I enjoy UX
          writing, along with creative writing in the forms of novels, novellas,
          and short stories of all genres. I currently write for a small
          magazine, publish short stories on Inkitt, and am hopeful to pursue
          publication of a full-length novel within the next few years.
